            We have been friends for a long time and found ourselves circling
            around the idea of wanting to start a new chapter, a new adventure,
            a new way to relate to our greater community. We decided to open a
            plant shop in our beloved University District neighborhood in
            Seattle.

            Just a short walk from University of Washington and University
            Village, our amazing space is always filled with light, and makes a
            great place to dive into creativity, or reverie with friends, family
            or coworkers. Our pub tables and large countertops are perfect for
            hosting our events, or yours.

                We started there and then quickly added classes with local
                artists. We started using our beautiful space during the day as
                a shop and the evening for creative workshops and a venue rental
                space.

                We have had many a beautiful party at StudioLife (birthday

                gatherings) - those events add to the magic of what has happened
                in our physical space on University Way. And it‚Äôs also been the
                place that we have found space for ourselves to retreat, learn
                and grow.

                We have loved the experience of connecting artists and learners
                from all over the country and world. It has broadened our reach
                and made many unique experiences possible. The creativity of
                people continues to astound us - from learners arranging classes
                with friends and family across the miles to artist-instructors
                strategizing how best to teach and connect with their growing
                communities. We are both wired to look for and enjoy the
                creativity in others, so we gain a lot of joy from this business
                of ours.
